# DatabaseConnector
Welcome! This is a .NET standard 2.0 library to interact with database.

For api documentation, please refer to [here](https://zzzrst.github.io/DatabaseConnector/api/DatabaseConnector.html)

Examples of usages will be updated soon. Please refer to the [article section](https://zzzrst.github.io/DatabaseConnector/articles/intro.html).

Note: For Oracle Database, if a file is provided, it will resort to using SQLPlus. Otherwise, dependency of having an Oracle client isn't required.
